# Introduction
This branch developed for the phase two of AI project focused on anomaly detection using the current model CNN3D. The script now utilize CNN3D model to detect anomalies in video data, recording the appearance and disappearance times of objects.
# Implementation
1. Download the source code from this branch in the repository.
2. Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
# Usage
Firstly, open file `main.py` and in line 103 replace path video in this line.
To run the anomaly detection script
```python
python .\main.py
```
The result is a chart illustrates the anomaly in the video.
## Main Libraries Used
1. **cv2**: Image processing and computer vision.
2. **torch**: Neural network processing.
3. **numpy**: Processing the numerical data.
